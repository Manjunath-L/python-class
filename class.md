# Operators:-

####   9+8

Operation :- it is an action or task that is performed on values based on the operator        used

Operands :- They are the values on which the operations are performed

Operator: They are special symbols or keywords which includes pre-defined functionality based on which an operation is performed on operands



Expression : A statement that performs an operation



 eg:   8 + 2 = expression



       There are 7 types of operator in python:

 

       a. Arithmetic OP

       b. Comparison / Relational Op

       c. Logical Op

       d. Bitwise OP

       e. Assignment Op

       f. Membership Op

       g. Identity Op



# Arithmetic Op:

 	- It is used to perform mathematical

 	- I/O: numbers(integer, decimals(float))

 	- O/p: numbers(integer, decimals(float))

 	- +,-,\*,\*\*\[exponentiation],/,//,%





+:

 	-When used with single number represents +Ve number

 	-When used with minimum of 2 numbers performs addition



-:

 	-When used with single number represents -Ve number

 	-When used with minimum of 2 numbers performs subtraction



\*:

 	- compulsorily when used with min of 2 numbers performs multiplication

        eg:

 		print(\*8)#error (TypeError)





\*\*\[exponentiation]:

 	- returns the exponent val of given 2 numbers

 		syn:

 			base \*\* power

 			print(2 \*\* 8)

 			print(4 \*\* 2)

 			print(3 \*\* 2)# 32 => 9

 			print(2 \*\* 3)# 23 => 8
