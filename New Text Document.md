# Operators

## Example

**9 + 8**

**Operation:** An action performed on values based on the operator used  
**Operands:** The values on which operations are performed  
**Operator:** Special symbols or keywords with predefined functionality used to perform operations  
**Expression:** A statement that performs an operation

Example:  
`8 + 2` → expression

# 1. Arithmetic Operators

- Used to perform mathematical operations
- **Input:** numbers (int, float)
- **Output:** numbers (int, float)
- Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, `/`, `//`, `%`

---

## `+` Operator

- With a single number → denotes positive value
- With two numbers → performs addition

---

## `-` Operator

- With a single number → denotes negative value
- With two numbers → performs subtraction

---

## `*` Operator

- Requires at least two numbers
- Performs multiplication  
  Example:  
  `print(*8)` → ❌ TypeError

---

## `**` (Exponentiation)

Returns result of raising base to power.

**Syntax:**  
`base ** power`

Examples:

- `2 ** 8` → 256
- `4 ** 2` → 16
- `3 ** 2` → 9
- `2 ** 3` → 8

---

## Note

`%` (modulus) internally uses floor division logic.

---

# Division Operators

## `//` (Floor Division)

Returns **non-decimal quotient**.

Example:  
`10 // 2` → 5
