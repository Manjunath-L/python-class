     b. TRIGGER
2. INBUILT FUNCTION:
     a. AGGREGATE 
     b. CHARACTER
     c. NUMBER
     d. DATE

1. AGGREGATE FUNCTION:
----------------------
1. MAX():
     TO OBTAIN THE MAXIMUM VALUE FROM THE GIVEN COL:

  SYNTAX:  
        SELECT MAX(COL_NAME)

2. MIN():
     TO OBTAIN THE MINIMUM VALUE FROM THE GIVEN COL.

SYNTAX: 
    SELECT MIN(COL_NAME)

3. AVG():
    TO OBTAIN THE AVERAGE VALUE FROM THE GIVEN COL.

     SELECT AVG(COL_NAME)

4. SUM():  
       TO OBTAIN THE SUM OF ALL THE VALUES WE USE SUM().

    SYNTAX:
      SELECT SUM(COL_NAME)

5. COUNT()
      TO OBTAIN THE NUMBER OF VALUES OF THE COL.
   SYNTAX: 
     SELECT COUNT(*)

NOTE: 
  > IN COUNT FUNCTION ONLY WE USE THE * AS AGRUMENT.

EXAMPLES:
------------------------
1. MAX(COLM_NAME);
    SELECT MAX(RUNS)
    FROM CRICKET;

2. MIN(COLUM_NAME);
   SELECT MIN(RUNS)
   FROM CRICKET;

3. AVG(COLUM_NAME);
   SELECT AVG(RUNS)
   FROM CRICKET;

4. SUM(COLUM_NAME);
   SELECT SUM(RUNS)
   FROM CRICKET;

5. COUNT(COLUM_NAME);
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM CRICKET;


34. WQTD MAX,MIN,SUM,AVG,SAL FROM THE EMP?
------------------------------------------------

SELECT MAX(SAL),MIN(SAL),SUM(SAL),AVG(SAL) 
FROM EMP;

35. WQTD NUMBER OF EMP WHO ARE WORKING AS SALESMAN?
--------------------------------------------------------
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM EMP
WHERE JOB='SALESMAN';

36. WQTD NUMBER OF EMP WORKING IN EACH DEPT
-------------------------------------------
SELECT COUNT(*),DNO
FROM EMP
GROUP BY DNO;


GROUP BY:
---------
IT IS USED TO CREATE GROUPS.

CHARACTERISTICS OF GROUP BY CLAUSE:
-----------------------------------
> IT EXECUTES ROW BY ROW
> IT EXECUTES AFTER THE FROM CLAUSE.
> IT EXECUTES ROW BY ROW BUT IT WILL BE CREATES GROUPS.
> WE CAN HAVE GROUP BY CLAUSE WITH OR WITHOUT USING THE FROM CLAUSE.

GROUP BY EXPRESSION:
--------------------
THE COLUMNS WHICH WE ARE PASSING INSIDE GROUP BY CLAUSE WILL BE CONSIDERED AS GROUP BY
EXPRESSION.

ORDER OF EXECUTION:
-------------------
1. FROM
2. [WHERE]
3. GROUP BY
4. SELECT

37. WQTD TOTAL SAL SPENT BY THE COMPANY IN EACH JOB ROLE IF THE JOB ROLES ARE 
    SALESMAN,MANAGER OR DEVELOPER?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT SUM(SAL),JOB
FROM EMP
WHERE JOB IN('SALESMAN','MANAGER','DEVELOPER')
GROUP BY JOB;

38.WQTD NUMBER OF DIFFERENT JOB ROLE PRESENT IN EMP TABLE?
---------------------------------------------------------
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT JOB)
FROM EMP;

39. WQTD MAXIMUN SAL GIVEN TO EACH DEPT IF THE MAXIMUN SAL IS GREATER THAN 50000?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT MAX(SAL),DNO
FROM EMP
GROUP BY DNO
HAVING MAX(SAL)>50000;

HAVING CLAUSE:
-------------
IT IS USED TO FILTER THE GROUP FUNCTION

CHARACTERISTICS OF HAVING CLAUSE:
---------------------------------
> IT EXECUTES GROUP BY GROUP
> IT EXECUTES AFTER THE GROUP BY CLAUSE
> IT EVELUATE TRUE OF FALSE
> WE CAN PASS MULTIPLE CONDITION IN HAVING CLAUSE.
> WE CAN'T USE NORMAL COLUMNS INSIDE HAVING CLAUSE.

ORDER OF EXECUTION:
------------------
1. FROM 
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING 
5. SELECT

40. WQTD MAXIMUM SAL AND MINIMUN SAL GIVEN TO EACH DEPT IF THE EMP ARE GETTING SAL 
    MORE THAN 32000 AND DEPT CONTAIN ATLEAST 3 EMP IN IT?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT MAX(SAL), MIN(SAL),DNO
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL>32000
GROUP BY DNO
HAVING COUNT(DNO) >=3;
